django-mailer-2 with support for AWS's SES (a fork of Chris Beaven's django-mailer-2  which is a fork of James Tauber's django-mailer)

A reusable Django app for queuing the sending of email

Amazon Web Service's Simple Email Service (SES) allow authentication through SMTP, which is nice so that you don't need to use boto anymore.  The problem is that it causes non-standard SMTP exception to be thrown to signify a failed message.  To deal with that, this fork catches SMTPDataError exceptions. 

To work correctly with SSL SMTP, you need to use the django_smtp_ssl.SSLEmailBackend backend (pip install django_smtp_ssl).  Additionally, certain python versions had an error in their SMTP_SSL class that wouldn't initialze the socket correctly (http://bugs.python.org/issue4066).  This bug existed in Python 2.6.1 and was fixed in 2.6.6.  I am not sure when exactly it was fixed.

Sample settings.py:
EMAIL_HOST = 'email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 465
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'username'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'password'
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django_smtp_ssl.SSLEmailBackend'
MAILER_USE_BACKEND = EMAIL_BACKEND
